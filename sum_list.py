# # 1: Basic function:
def sum_list(my_list):
    sum = 0
    for x in my_list:
        sum += x


# # 2: Adding a return statement:
# def sum_list(my_list):
#     sum = 0
#     for x in my_list:
#         sum += x
#     return sum


# # 3: Adding in a call to the function:
# def sum_list(my_list):
#     sum = 0
#     for x in my_list:
#         sum += x
#     return sum
#
# numbers = [2, 8, 7, 13, 6]
# my_sum = sum_list(numbers)
# print(my_sum)
